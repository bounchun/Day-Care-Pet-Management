🐶🐱 Day Care Pet Management System
## 📌 Project Overview

The Pet Day Care Management System is a Java console application that helps staff manage pets during periods when their owners are at work, travelling, or on vacation.
The system eliminates paper-based records and sticky notes by providing a structured, user-friendly digital solution that is designed to evolve into a future mobile application.
The system offers comprehensive pet management features, including adding, updating, deleting, searching, sorting, and reporting, while ensuring capacity and pricing rules are strictly applied.
